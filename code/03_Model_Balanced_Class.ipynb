Vita's home was an absolute urban oasis!  I was absolutely comfortable with the private accomodations.  I regret not being able to spend more time with Vita and her family.   I had a wonderful stay and look forward to being a guest in the future.   \n",

I stayed for three nights while sightseeing in D.C. - the location is very convenient and Vita provided maps and guides. The room is lovely, the shower is hot and Vita shared her tasty vegan cooking! Would happily stay again.   \n",
